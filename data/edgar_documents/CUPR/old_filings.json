The studies, each one year in length, were aimed at helping Cuprina\nand these institutes jointly produce collagen peptide molecules derived from American bullfrog skin. These peptides, as well as their\nshort chain variants, are widely considered to be useful in the manufacture of an array of medical, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and\ncosmetic products.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe\nfirst study was performed pursuant to a consultancy proposal (\u201cCP\u201d) signed in February 2024 with Republic Polytechnic (\u201cRP\u201d),\nan institute of higher learning under the purview of the Ministry of Education in Singapore. Under this agreement, Cuprina and RP collaborated\nto generate bullfrog collagen peptides that can be sold as is or separated and sold as individual peptide fragments.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSince\nthe completion of this consultancy proposal in February 2025, Cuprina has identified a method to generate a series of these peptides\nthat can potentially be used for cosmeceutical applications including skin moisturization, collagen remodeling, and other commercial\napplications. Cuprina is currently in the process of pursuing marketing opportunities for these peptides with a number of cosmeceutical\nentities.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCuprina\u2019s\nsecond study, a research collaboration agreement (\u201cRCA\u201d) which commenced in October 2024, was signed with the Institute for\nHealth Innovation and Technology at the National University of Singapore, Singapore\u2019s flagship university that offers a global\napproach to education, research and entrepreneurship. Joint research from this agreement is aimed at exploring the viability of using\nbullfrog collagen peptides in the production of 3D printable wound care dressings for a variety of research and clinical applications.\nFunding for this research is supported by the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Cluster Singapore, a national platform hosted\nby the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCurrently,\nCuprina is performing testing aimed at measuring the effect of integrating bullfrog collagen into the structure of microneedling patches,\nwhich contain tiny needles that allow active ingredients to penetrate deeper into the skin and enhance wound healing.\u00a0If these tests\nprove successful, these new patches could help to control the inflammation that typically impedes wound healing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n",

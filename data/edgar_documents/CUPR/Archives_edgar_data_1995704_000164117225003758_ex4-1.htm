of (i) three (3) Trading Days after the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise, (ii) two (2) Trading Days after delivery of
the aggregate Exercise Price to the Company and (iii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period after the delivery
to the Company of the Notice of Exercise (such date, the <b><i>&ldquo;Warrant Share Delivery Date&rdquo;</i></b>). Upon delivery of the
Notice of Exercise, the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of record of the Warrant Shares with
respect to which this Warrant has been exercised, irrespective of the date of delivery of the Warrant Shares. If the Company fails for
any reason to deliver to the Holder the Warrant Shares subject to a Notice of Exercise by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company
shall pay to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise
(based on the VWAP of the Class A Ordinary Shares on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), $10 per Trading Day (increasing to
$20 per Trading Day on the fifth Trading Day after such liquidated damages begin to accrue) for each Trading Day after such Warrant Share
Delivery Date until such Warrant Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such exercise. The Company agrees to maintain a transfer agent
that is a participant in the FAST program so long as this Warrant remains outstanding and exercisable. As used herein, <b><i>&ldquo;Standard
Settlement Period&rdquo;</i></b> means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Company&rsquo;s primary
Trading Market with respect to the Class A Ordinary Shares as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Exercise.</p>

above pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required by its broker
to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder&rsquo;s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, Class A Ordinary Shares
to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a
<b><i>&ldquo;Buy-In&rdquo;</i></b>), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder&rsquo;s
total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the Class A Ordinary Shares so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained
by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise
at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the
Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in
which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of Class A Ordinary Shares that would have been
issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Class
A Ordinary Shares having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of Class A Ordinary
Shares with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding
sentence the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts
payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall
limit a Holder&rsquo;s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation,
a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company&rsquo;s failure to timely deliver Class A Ordinary
Shares upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.</p>

Limitations</u>. The Company shall not affect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion
of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise as set forth
on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder&rsquo;s Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group
together with the Holder or any of the Holder&rsquo;s Affiliates (such Persons, <b><i>&ldquo;Attribution Parties&rdquo;</i></b>)), would
beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number
of Class A Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of Class
A Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the
number of Class A Ordinary Shares which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially
owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted
portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Class A Ordinary Share Equivalents) subject to
a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates
or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial ownership shall be
calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged
by the Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation
contained in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned
by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the
sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder&rsquo;s determination of whether
this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties)
and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall
have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated
above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For
purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding
Class A Ordinary Shares as reflected in (A) the Company&rsquo;s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the
case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent
setting forth the number of Class A Ordinary Shares outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within
one Trading Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of Class A Ordinary Shares then outstanding. In any case, the number
of outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company,
including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding Class
A Ordinary Shares was reported. The <b><i>&ldquo;Beneficial Ownership Limitation&rdquo; </i></b>shall be 4.99% (or, upon election by a
Holder prior to the issuance of any Warrant, 9.99%) of the number of Class A Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect
to the issuance of Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase
or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in
no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of Class A Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of Class A
Ordinary Shares upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply. Any
increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61<sup>st </sup>day after such notice is delivered to
the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with
the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended
Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such
limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.</p>

part of any other registration of securities filed by the Company (other than (i) a registration effected solely to implement an employee
benefit plan or a transaction to which Rule 145 of the Act is applicable, or (ii) a registration statement on Form F-4, S-8 or any successor
form thereto or another form not available for registering the Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant for sale to the public),
whether for its own account or for the account of one or more shareholders of the Company (a &ldquo;<b>Piggyback Registration</b>&rdquo;),
the Company shall give prompt written notice (in any event no later than thirty (30) days prior to the filing of such registration statement)

2(f), shall include in such registration such number of the Registrable Securities that the Holders have (within thirty (30) days of the

Shares issuable upon exercise of this Purchase Warrant (if the Holder has elected to include such shares in such Piggyback Registration)
and all other shares of common stock proposed to be included in such underwritten offering, the Company shall include in such registration
(i) first, the number of Class A Ordinary Shares that the Company proposes to sell and (ii) second, the number of Class A Ordinary Shares,
if any, requested to be included therein by selling shareholders (including the Holder) allocated pro rata among all such persons on the
basis of the number of Class A Ordinary Shares then owned by each such person. If any Piggyback Registration is initiated as a primary
underwritten offering on behalf of the Company, the Company shall select the investment banking firm or firms to act as the managing underwriter
or underwriters in connection with such offering. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the obligations of the Company pursuant to
this Section 2(f) shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the effective date of the Registration Statement and
(ii) the date that Rule 144 would allow the Holder to sell its Registrable Securities during any ninety (90) day period, and shall not
be applicable so long as the Company&rsquo;s Registration Statement on Form F-1 (No. 333-283643) covering the Registrable Securities remains
effective at such time.</p>

Consideration issuable in respect of one Class A Ordinary Share in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise
Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate
Consideration. If holders of Class A Ordinary Shares are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental
Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant
following such Fundamental Transaction. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company
is not the survivor (the <b><i>&ldquo;Successor Entity&rdquo;</i></b>) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under
this Warrant in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3(e) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of
the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially
similar in form and substance to this Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor
Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the Class A Ordinary Shares acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without
regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies
the exercise price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the Class A Ordinary Shares
pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such
exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental
Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction,
the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions
of this Warrant referring to the &ldquo;Company&rdquo; shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and
power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant with the same effect as if such Successor
Entity had been named as the Company herein.</p>

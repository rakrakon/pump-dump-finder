Offering made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriter Information. The indemnification obligations under this <u>Section

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1in">(c) <u>Procedure</u>. Promptly after
receipt by an indemnified party under this <u>Section 8</u> of notice of the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall,
if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this <u>Section 8</u>, notify such indemnifying party
in writing of the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve
it from any liability which it may have under this <u>Section 8</u> except to the extent it has been materially adversely prejudiced by
such failure; and, provided, further, that the failure to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it
may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this <u>Section 8</u>. If any such action shall be brought against an indemnified
party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the
extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense of such action with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (which counsel shall not, except with the written consent of the indemnified party, be
counsel to the indemnifying party). After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense
of such action, except as provided herein, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under <u>Section 8(a)</u>
or <u>8(b)</u>, as applicable, for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense
of such action other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that any indemnified party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense of such action but the fees and expenses of such separate counsel
(other than reasonable costs of investigation) shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment thereof has
been specifically authorized in writing by the Company in the case of a claim for indemnification under <u>Section 8(a)</u>, (ii) such
indemnified party shall have been advised by its counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or (iii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense of such
action and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party within a reasonable period of time after notice of the commencement
of the action or the indemnifying party does not diligently defend the action after assumption of the defense, in which case, if such
indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying
party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of (or, in the case of a failure to diligently defend the
action after assumption of the defense, to continue to defend) such action on behalf of such indemnified party and the indemnifying party
shall be responsible for reasonable legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
of such action; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially
similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable
fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for any such indemnified party (in addition to any local counsel),
which firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters if the indemnified party under this <u>Section 8</u> is an Underwriter Indemnified
Party or by the Company if an indemnified party under this <u>Section 8</u> is a Company Indemnified Party. Subject to this <u>Section
8(c)</u>, the amount payable by an indemnifying party under <u>Section 8</u> shall include, but not be limited to, (x) reasonable legal
fees and expenses of counsel to the indemnified party and any other expenses in investigating, or preparing to defend or defending against,
or appearing as a third party witness in respect of, or otherwise incurred in connection with, any action, investigation, proceeding or
claim, and (y) all amounts paid in settlement of any of the foregoing. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent
of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to any pending or threatened action
or any claim whatsoever, in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this <u>Section 8</u> (whether or not
the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional
release of each indemnified party in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party from all liability arising out
of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on
behalf of any indemnified party. Subject to the provisions of the following sentence, no indemnifying party shall be liable for settlement
of any pending or threatened action or any claim whatsoever that is effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), but if settled with its written consent, if its consent has been unreasonably withheld or delayed or if there be
a judgment for the plaintiff in any such matter, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from
and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. In addition, if at any time an indemnified party shall have
requested that an indemnifying party reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees
that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated herein effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement
is entered into more than ninety (90) days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the request for reimbursement, (ii) such indemnifying
party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least sixty (60) days prior to such settlement being entered into
and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of
such settlement.</p>

indemnification provided for in this <u>Section 8</u> is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under <u>Section
8(a)</u> or <u>Section 8(b)</u>, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the
amount paid, payable or otherwise incurred by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, expense or liability (or
any action, investigation or proceeding in respect thereof), as incurred, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand from the Offering, or
(ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) of this <u>Section 8</u>(d) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) of this <u>Section 8(d) </u>but also the relative fault
of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other with respect to the statements, omissions, acts or failures
to act which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, expense or liability (or any action, investigation or proceeding in respect thereof)
as well as any other relevant equitable considerations as determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. The relative
benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be
in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the Offering purchased by investors as contemplated by this Agreement (before deducting
expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts received by the Underwriters in connection with the Offering,
in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the
Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand
or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such untrue statement, omission, act or failure to act; provided that the parties hereto agree that the written information
furnished to the Company by the Underwriters for use in any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in
any amendment or supplement thereto, consists solely of the Underwriter Information. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would
not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this <u>Section 8(d)</u> be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method
of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified
party as a result of the loss, claim, damage, expense, liability, action, investigation or proceeding referred to above in this <u>Section
8(d)</u> shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this <u>Section 8(d)</u>, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third party witness in
respect of, or otherwise incurred in connection with, any such loss, claim, damage, expense, liability, action, investigation or proceeding.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this <u>Section 8(d)</u>, the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the total discounts received in cash by the Underwriters in connection with the Offering less the amount of any damages that the Underwriters
have otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission, act or
alleged act or failure to act or alleged failure to act. No person, guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

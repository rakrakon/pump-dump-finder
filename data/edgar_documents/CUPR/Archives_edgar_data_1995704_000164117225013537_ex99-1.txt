Cuprina
Completes Lab Able to Supply MEDIFLY Chronic Wound Therapy Across MENA

Region,
Secures Exclusive License to Market Medicinal Leeches in GCC Countries

 

SINGAPORE,
June 4, 2025 – Cuprina Holdings (Cayman) Limited (Nasdaq: CUPR) (“CUPR” or “the Company”),
a biomedical and biotechnology company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products for the management of chronic wounds
and infertility, as well as cosmeceuticals for the health and beauty sector, today announced that its indirect 49%-owned associate, Cuprina
MENA Co. Ltd, had completed the set-up of a laboratory, located in Saudi Arabia, equipped to manufacture the company’s MEDIFLY
maggot debridement therapy for the treatment of chronic wounds and to supply the therapy across the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”)
region.

 

Cuprina
MENA is now working towards obtaining the regulatory approvals, including the Saudi Food and Drug Authority license and ISO 13485 certification,
required in order to sell the therapy in the MENA region.

 

In
another development, Cuprina MENA has secured exclusive rights from Biopharm UK Ltd (“BioPharm”), the world’s leading
provider of medicinal leeches, to sell these leeches across the Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) countries.

 

Medicinal
leeches are increasingly used in the GCC to treat diverse medical conditions including venous congestion, which is a buildup of blood
in the veins, and to aid in tissue healing and circulation following reconstructive and microsurgery procedures. The leeches are also
used to relieve symptoms of osteoarthritis as well as in veterinary surgery, especially to help treat polycythaemia vera, a chronic blood
cancer.

 

“We
are excited to complete both of these milestones,” said Cuprina chief executive David Quek. “These achievements, we believe,
will help us to expand our market reach in the MENA and GCC regions, and add significant incremental revenue for our company.

 

“I
look forward to sharing updates on these developments in the near future.”
